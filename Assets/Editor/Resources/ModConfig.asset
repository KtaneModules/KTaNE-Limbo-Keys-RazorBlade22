  description: "IT'S BLUE!!! IT'S BLUE!!! IT'S BLUE!!! IT'S BLUE!!!\r\n\r\nThis is
    a defuser solo module that I had the idea of making for a while now. I'll be honest,
    my friend GhostSalt did most of the work for this module. I want to give them
    a huge thanks. Without them, this module wouldn't be possible.\r\n\r\nThis module
    also has TP support included.\r\nThere are some mod settings as well.\r\n\r\nMod
    Setting 'Mute Music' mutes the music as the keys shuffle.\r\n\r\nMod Setting 'FOCUS'
    forces you to select the key the first time it flashes. If you pick no key, it
    will strike\r\n(Can not be enabled is No Music is active)\r\n(Makes the border
    color red instead of blue)\r\n(Not supported by Twitch Plays)\r\n\r\nMod Setting
    'Boss Mode' makes it so Limbo Keys is inactive until the final module. Striking
    will explode the bomb regardless of the strikes remaining.\r\n(Can only be enabled
    if FOCUS mode is active)\r\n(Shows an eye when it's inactive)"
